Boilerplate Design
#Issue
1. Need to be able to write Solidity code in a JavaScript project
2. Need some way to rapidly test contracts without doing the manual testing we were doing with Remix
3. Need some way to deploy our contract to public networks
#Solution
1. Set up the Solidity compiler to build our contracts
2. Set up custom Mocha test runner that can somehow test Solidity code
3. Set up a deploy script to compile+deploy our contract
