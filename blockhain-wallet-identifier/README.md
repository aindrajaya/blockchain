<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Wallet Integration
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Web3 wallet is the crucial thing for blockchain development – registering and authenticating users from their own wallet can be a pain. There are some Users behaviour that drove them to get routinely forget their passwords, lose access to their sign on email address, and sometimes they ask their own colleagues, friends or broter/sisters to guess and help them answers to their password reset questions. The main focus that users have a big incentive to keep their Web3 wallet secure, because it is associated with assets

Here's an importance thing of keeping keys secure:
* If you lose your key, you will no longer have any access to assets or accounts that the key protects
* If someone else has access to your key, that person is now you for all purposes. There is no way for applications, or the blockchain itself, to distinguish between you and another person who has your key
