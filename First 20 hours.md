1. Deconstruct the skill
decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you're done and then look into the skill and break it down into smaller pieces. Most of the things that we think of as skills are actualy big bundles of skills that require all sorts of different things. The more you can break apart the skill, the more you're able to decide, what are the parts of this skill that would actually help me get to what I want? And then you can practice those first. And if you practice the most important things first, you'll be able to improve your performance in the least amount of time possible

2. Learn enough to self-corect
So, get three to five resources about what it is you're trying to learn. Could be books, DVDs, courses, could be anything. But don't use those as a way to procrastinate on practice. Just, get like 20 books about the topic, like I'm gonna to start learning how to program a computer when I complete these 20 books, That's procrastination. What you want to do is learn just enough that you can actually practice and self correct or self edit as you practice. So the learning becomes a way of getting better at noticing when you're making mistake and then dsoing something a little different.\

3. Remove practice barriers
Distractions, television, internet. All of these things that get in the way of you actually sitting down and doing the work. And the more you're able to use just a little bit of willpower to remove the distractions that are keeping you from practicing, the more likely you are to actually sit down and practice, right?

4. Practice at least 20 hours
Now, most skills have what I call a frustation barrier. You know, the grossly-incompetent-and-knowing-it part? That's really, realy frustating. We don't like to feel stupid. And feeling stupid is a barrier to us actually sitting down and doing the work. So, by pre-committing to practicing whatever it is that you want to do for at leas 20 hours, you will be able to ovecome that initial frustation barrier and stick with the practice long enough to actually reap the rewards.

NOTES: The major barrier to skill acquisitions isn't intellectual, it's not the process of you learning a bunch of little tips or tricks or things.., It's emotional. The major barrier's emotional. We're scared. feeling stupid doesn't feel good in the beginning of learning anything new if you fell really stupid

1. BLOCKCHAIN CORE DEVELOPER
Build the software that runs the blockchain, need to know low level languages like c++, rust or golang and really depends on which blocks and client you choose (like go-eth(go), openethereum(rust)).

2. BLOCKCHAIN FRONTEND EXPERT
Will focus on build the frontend of blockchain application and make them as beautiful and as user friendly as you can, in this expertise we're talking about the application that run on top of the blockchain (Need to master, HTML CSS and Javascript). And need to know how to manage the state of your frontend. Build reusable components (Storybooks that can documents your component in a nice visual catalog). And also know how to test your frontend (unit testing and then integration testing jest, RTL and Cypress for integration). Used to know Typescript. Need to know Web3 and Ethers, Need to know some ethereum API services like Infure, Quicknode and Tenderly. Need to know to integrate the frontend with Ethereum wallets where users keep their private keys client-side (like MetaMask, Formatic, Torus, recommend to use Web3Modal that can do the integration with many wallets) -> need to lear also Smart Wallets (how to know it works).

3. SOLIDITY MASTER
- You will focus to create advanced smart contracts. 
- Need to know well EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) with its different memory location and how the code of a smart contract is executed. 
- And then you need to know how to write safe smart contract. 
- Need to not have smart contract security vulnerabilities and bug so you need to know the typical security vulnerabilities of solidity and how to avoid them. 
- Need to know a few of security tools like Mithrill and the next you can also know how to do smart contracts audits (high paying developer). 
- And you know to write good tests (need to be comprehensive, test coverage need to be high) for your smart contracts. 
- Another skill to be needed is Gas Optimization code (you should strive to write smart contracts that consume as little gas as possible), and this skill is very related with the another important skill like mastery of assembly (a low level smart contract language, that allow you to interact directly with elementary instructions of the ethereum virtual machine that we call opcodes. But you need often to avoid this because it's easier to have security vulnerabilities with assembly, but also in some cases we have no choice for example for some evm operations we can't do them in solidity we need the flexibility of assembly also if you need to do some gas optimization sometimes it's only possible in assembly). 
- Need to know Solidity tools and frameworks(Truffle, Openzeppelin, Hardhat, Buidler, compute automatically wiht test coverage, gas consumpitions and linters to format your code). 
- There is a way to run these tools automatically after each commit such as CI. Smart Contract Debugging (by using Remix ETH)

4. DEFI EXPERT
- is a specific Use case of ethreum blockchain that reinvent finance but on the blockchain
- first you should be able to understand the individual building blocks of defy (tokens, liquidity pools, yield farming, flash loans and etc)
- know how to interaction with main DeFi (and also know the main defi projects works) projects from smart contracts and from web applications
- Build your own DeFi project
