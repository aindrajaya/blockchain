Example Project

## Projects Requirements
We are looking for a developer to provide a crypto backed stablecoin protocol (EVM chain) which may be a customized fork of an existing project. </br>
For example:
- forking existing project
- adding collateral options (and required oracles)
- adding additional checks to ensure user is approved to create new borrow position (ex, user must have some % staked gov token vs existing debt + new debt they want to take out)
- modifying behavior of debt positions (ex, instead of adding interest to total debt, have interest paid current by sending some of the collateral to treasury on regular basis and at repayment of debt position)
- revamp branding/front-end design/interface </br>
Deliverables will include customized front and backend, deployment, source and documentation.  We also expect to need hourly services for platform management and deployment on additional chains.</br>
Budget Around = 7000usd
