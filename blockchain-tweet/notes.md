## The Beginning
2008 Sathoshi Nakamoto Published, Bitcoin: A P2P Electroninc Cash System
### Explaining:
* The reversibility ands trustability issues
* Bitcoin, a p2p version of electroninc cash (not blockchain)
* The Mechanics of Consensus
### What was the blockchain
The blockchain was only a special type of shared, and secured database, not ownerd by any entiry, used to runi the Bitcoin. A cryptographed and autoregulated collected of transactions data, validated and stored on a network of computers.
### The Blockchain Today:
The blockchain today is a much larger concepts, that reanges from Distributed Cloud copmuting to, of course Cryptovalues and NFTs. 
### Why is the Blockchain Imprtant?
Humans have this huge problem called: **Trustability**. Everything in our society orbits around ways to ensure trust between two or moreparts. Simply put: Blockchain sovles the problem of trustability, decentralizing it.
### How do we ensure trustability? 
We can use the most disparate methods (Contracts, Reviews, Stars, Scores). All of those trustability proofs are then signed by centralized entities such as governments, companies, or organizations, to ensure validity. 
### What Centralization Mean?
The contentration of control of activity under a single authorithy. All tust proofs are stored and signed by single entities, in closed databases around the globe. This causes huge frictions derived from data validation & handling.
### Why is giving data to a centralized institutions bad? 
Centralization is not bad, is obsolete. There are several reasons: (High copsts, Tracebility, Speed). Let's go through those and understand how the blockchain addresses those concerns.
#### Centralization and higher costs:
This comes with the problem of reversebility or "the middle man" as described by Satoshi Nakamoto. If somtething is reversibel-> requires internmedieries and intermedieries are expensive
#### Centralization and Traceability:
Having a private database maeks it hard for companies, users, governments to keep track of the validity of data, and share data consistently. This creates frictions derived from the processes to validate the information.
#### Centralized institutions are slow:
This is because intermediaries have to verify the validityu of data, through combersome processes. Think about starting a morgage, or opening a company, or simply renting a car, this takes a considerable amount of time.
#### How can we solve centralization's issues?
Decentralizing. Removing internediareies, creating treust via set of tampering proof, irreversible, automated, and distributed technology-driven processes. Also called, the blockchain.
### What is the Blockchain?
The blockchain is a distributed network of nodes, tha tare sharing a public databse, containing cryptographed adata and iformation about the transaction of that data. Think about it like a huge open database, hosted on multiple computers. 
### How does the blockchain works?
The blockchain is comprised of: 
* Nodes, where copies of the blockchain are stored
* Blocks to store ands ecure data
* Consensus and Proof of Work
#### What are blockchain nodes?
Nodes are where the blockchain resides. Every sustem connected to the blockchain is considered as node and shares an identical copy of the blockchain with all other nodes. Nodes constantly exchange data to keep themself up-to-date.
#### What are blockchain nodes responsible for?
* Block validation
* Transaction processing
Nodes serve the required CPU power to maintain the blockchain and validate transactions. Trust me, the blockchain is greedy.
#### What are Blcokchain Blocsk?
A blockchain is a chain of blocks that contain informatin> The data which is tored isnide a block depends on the type of blockchain. A bitcoin block contains information about Sender, Receiver, number of Bitcoins to be transferred. 
#### How does a Blockchain block Look like?
Every block has:
* Data
* Individual Hash
* Hash of the previous block (parent hash)
The first block (Genesis block) is the only one without a parent hash.
#### Why are Blockchain Blocks Secure?
Every block in the blockchain has a unique SHA256 HASH that identifier its content, shared with the subsequent block. If you change the hash, tthis will not correspond anymore to his children's parent has, invalidating the block.
### The Consensus Mechanism.
A consensus mechanism refers to any number of methodologies used to achieve agreement, trust, and across a decentralized computer network. The most popular blockchain is POW.
#### Proof of Work Blockchain
Proof of Work (PoW) is the mechanism that allows decentralized networks to come to a consensus, or agree on things like account balances or a block to be modifier. A computational problem sets the difficulty for the work miners do. Every time a new node needs to be added or modified to the blockchain, a computational problem is sered and the first CPU to solve it validates the blocks. This is what miners, active in the blockchain, do.
#### How Miners Demonstrte Proof of Work?
Miners gues a nonce (number used once), via bilions of trials and error, hevilty relying on CPU. Once a node resolves the nonce, it broadcasts the result to the other nodes, and a new block is appended ot the blockchain.
#### Proof of Work is Like a Lottery:
A guessing job wher e the miner's CPU nedes to choose a nnumber. The difficulty is based on the total amount of blocks/time/nodes. Each CPU has only a limited chance to be the "winner", creating an unprecedented equal distribution. And the blockchain is a Decentralized Network. Blockchains are used a distributed p2p networik, where, when public everyone can join. When someone enters the network he/she gets a full copyu of the blockchain, forming a node.
#### Network Consensus
Because all the nodes in a blockchain share the same copy, everyone is responsible for data validation. Every time a node enters the blockchain, the whole network needs to verify the node transaction histopry and hasehes, forming consensus.
#### Why the Blockchain Concumes so Much Energy?
Because PoW is CPU intensive. Satoshi Nakamoto clearly explains that the costs in the blockchain are shifted from nmoney to Electricity and CPU power. With a huge environment impact. 
### Security and Privacy in the Blockchain. 
The enhanced security offered by blockcghain stems from how the technology works; Blockchain creates an unalterable record of cryptographed transacitons with e2e encryption, whichs shuts out fraud and unauthorized activity.
### Traceability in the Blockchain
Walmart uses the blockchain to trace the origin of mangoes. Every node contains its transaction hisotry, with data caryptographed on demand, creating a shared irreversible open ledger, freely consulable by the ndoes on the network.
### Blockchain is not fast (yet)
Unfortunately, even if the technology is promising and could become ligthning-fast, Blockchain is still pretty slow. PoW, and the need for every node to validate each transaction, slows down the process tremendously.
#### How Slow a Blockchain is?
* The Bitcoin Blockchain caps at 7 transaction/second
* The Ethereum blockchain caps at 14 transaction/second
* A credit card network caps at 25000 transaction/second.
### So How does the BLockchain Solve Trustability issues?
* Creting a dsitributed database
* That lives on a decentralied network of computers
* Autoregulated by consensus
Removing the need for an intemediary, while keeping data free form any owner.
### The different stages of the Blockchain.
As said before the blockchain today is a much lareger concept, that goes from Distributed CLoud COmputing to, NFTs
We can divide Blockchains's journey in:
* Blockchain 1.0
* Blockchain 2.0
* Blockchain 3.0
#### Blockchain 1.0: Currency
Ther implementaino of the distributed ledger techinlogy led to its first and ovious application: Cryptocurrencies. This allows financial transaction based on blockchain technology. Bitcoin is the most prominent example.
#### Blockchain 2.0: Smart Contracts
Smart Contracts are small computer programs the "live" in the blockchain. Used as a contract replacement, Smart contracts execute automatically and check conditions defined earlier like facilitation, varification, or enforcement.
#### Blockchain 3.0: dApp (Decentralized Application)
dApps is an abbreviation of decentralization applications, having their bacekdn code running on a decentralied p2p network. A dapp can have a frontend written in any language that can make a request to its backend, like a traditional web app.
### Blockchain Developer Salary.
The use cases of the blockchain range from decentralized storage to Real-time IoT applications and Personal Identity security. This, plus the lack of blockchain developers, make salaries skyrocket to $140k/year on average, rising.
### The Limitations of the BLockchain
The blockchain is till at an eraly stage though, full of limitations, but expanding at an impressive rate. Here's cheat sheet of the limitations of blockchain
* Slower process, Blockchain is slow due to proof of work and may also slow down due to low CPU power connected to the network.
* Immutable Dat, Revesing a blockchain opertion is almost impossible because data is immutable.
* Harder to scale, Blockchains are hared to scale due to Consensus mechanics
* Inefficient, Blockchains are sometimes inefficient due to how they operate
* Energy Consumption, PoW requires intensive CPU and Elevtiricty effor
* Integration, Hard to integrate into legacy systems
* Self-maintenance, Users have to maintaint their access keys or they can lose access to their belongings.
* Not mature,. It sill has a long way to go before it matures and get standardized.
* Interoperability, Blockchain doesn't offer interoperability as of now.
### Conclusions:
Even it the Blockchain is still a proof of concept, it already runs thousands of decentralied applications and milions of users. A market of $1.5 trillion, eager for developers, making it one of the most in-demand skills in the tech industry
