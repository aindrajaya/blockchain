----------------------------------
From 2009, when Satoshi Nakamoto implementad blockchain technology as a core component in Bitcoin, blockchain has been the buzzword in the industry. Bitcoin's success proved the capabilities of blockchain-based transactions, and now, everyone is planning to implement blockchain technologyh in almost everything. According to the World Economic Forum survey, by 2027, 10 percent of the glocal GDP may be stored using nono other than blockchain-based technology. Interesting, isn't?
As you can see, from digital transactions to the voting process, or form storing documents and transactions to making data transfer decentralized, blockchain tech is going to be everywhere. So for developers working this spcae, here's the main questions: how do you know that yout blockchain app is working the wayh you want it to work? In simpler terms, how can you test blockchain? First, let's; dive a little deeper into what exactly is blockchain technology, how it can help us, and what all needs to be tested in a blockchain.

#What is Blockchain?
A blockchain is basically like a distributed ledger that stores the database of of assets and transactions done across a peer-to-peer network. You can think of a blockchain as an open infrastructure that cans tore various types of assets. Let me take this to a simpler level. Imagine you have to amake a transaction of $10 from A to B. Now, in normal scenarios, what happens is that the trasaction takes place through a third-party app or payment processing system. First, A's bank will identify processing service, A's bank will initiate a money transfer to B's bank with a certain amount of deductions. Both banks will record transaction at their end. However, a transaction fee is charged and B receives something like $9.95. This process is quite secure and has many redundancies in place to make sure that it stays secure and accurate, but even then, there are some basic fundamental issues with the transaction process:
--> Delay in process
--> Dependency on a single intermediary whose effectiveness in never 100 percent
--> In case of any gap in the transactions, no one takes the responsibility and people keep on blaming each other.

#How BLockchain Eliminates These Problems?
Consider if there is a system where you no longer have to worry about these problems. You just need to perform a transaction and there are people who are sitting and validating your transaction every second. The validation mechanism is called as Proof of block, and this is done based on the public key provided for the encrypted data, and its done by all listeners in the perr-to-peer network. And these are real people, not bots. Since there is not a single transaction validating authority, i.e. no centralized transaction service, the process is effectively decentralized.
Once more than a specified number of people validates the transcation, the transaction details are stored in the form of a block and that block is added to the existing blockchain. Moreover, the blocks, once validated and added, are immutable. These blocks have a specific hash associated with everyh block. These hashes are like fingerprints and are unique to every block. The persons validating the transaction process are called mintes. The more miners, the better efficiency of the transaciont. A block, in all, contains data, a hash, and the hash the previous block. Since it contains a hash of a previous block, all the blocks contain data for the previous blocks and it becomes almost impossible for a blockchain to be corrupt.

So you can think of this as a distributed ledger where a lot of people are acrively updating and validating your transaction details based on the decryption keyh that is provided. And once more than a specific numbe rof people validates the transaction a new block is added to the blockchain.	

#What is the Nede for Testing in a Blockchain?
A block, once added to the blockchain, remains there forever, and if you try to change the data in some block in between the chain, the following blocks become invalid. A single change in a block of the blockchain will cause every subsquent bllock to change as well. This makes it important that whenever a new block is added, it's being added the right way because it cannot be changed at a later data. It becomes complex exploiting a blockchain, and the testing of blockchain becomes even more complex. To add to that, it contributes to large transactions, which go through validation, encryption, decryption, transmission, etc. so it becomes necesasry to make sure that these process go smoothly.

#What all Do you Need to Test in a Blockchain?
1. Block Size: The maximum fixed limit of a block is 1 Megabyte. After the introduction of Bitcoin, the average size of a block for the first 18 months came out to be under 30kb. But in December 2017, it hovered around 1 MB. What it size of a block exceeds beyond 1MB? Well , this is yet to be decided how blocks above 1MB pan out.
2. Chain Size: There is no llimit on the size of the chain. So, it is fun to test it for its function and peformance. For example, the Bitcoin chain's size keeps on increasing day by day. If you want ot know the current chain size, just hit here.
3. Load: With so many people on the blockchain, the load becomes a major parameter to test in a blockchain. Let's take the example of Bitcoin. It currently has a maximum throughput 0f 3-4 transactions per second
